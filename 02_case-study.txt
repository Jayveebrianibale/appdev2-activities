Our IT company embarked on an ambitious project in January 2024 aimed at delivering a cutting-edge software solution
to our users and clients. The project was meticulously planned with a target launch date of June 1. However, as the
deadline approaches, it becomes apparent that several tasks are still in progress, and there are unresolved bugs that
need attention. The testing process, crucial for ensuring product quality, has not yet begun. As a software engineer
involved in the project, what aspects could have been handled better to prevent the delays and issues experienced,
such as incomplete tasks, unresolved bugs, and a delayed testing process?

Answer: 

As a software developer or engineer involved in the project, I use Agile Methodology because agile is an iterative approach
that can easily handle task in every sprints. It allows project feedback and adjustments to prevent delays. I can ensure
accurate estimation to complete every task of the project.
